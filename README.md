### Project Description

This is a mock webstore, for an "Audio store", that lets the admin control, what items to post, remove, edit, and delete. This mock web store will let users log in, and add stuff to their cart and leave reviews and view reviews on the headphones. Carts will also be saved using local storage.

### User Stories

As a user I would like to be able to sign in, and be able to navigate easily throughout the web-store. Also I would like to be able to add the headphones I like to my cart. I would also like to leave, edit, and delete comments on the headphones that I like. In my cart I want the sum of the headphones to be given, with the amount of items.

### Technologies Used

Python, Django, Javascript, React.JS, Redux, Bulma, HTML, and CSS.

### Goals 

Have a landing page where user can easily navigate to their next decision. Nav bar that is fixed to the top of the screen. Have users/ with user authentication where, their carts are saved, items can be put and taken out of your cart. Reviews can be left on certain items. Give the subtotal of the audio equipement in the cart, and a carts page where it displays all the itemâ€™s in your cart.
